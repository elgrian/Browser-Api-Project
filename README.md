<h1>Animation API</h1>

<p> I recently began building a website for my Software Product Development class and decided to add some cool little animations into my page, to make it pop out to the user more.
  
  Some issues I had were getting the animation to go at a decent speed, and making it go down the page, just enough to where it was near the edge. The first issue I ran into was that, when on a larger screen, the ribbon animation would actually move off the screen. I fixed this by changing the location with position absolute, making the animation flow in smoothly.
